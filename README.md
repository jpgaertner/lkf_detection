Notebooks used to analyze sea ice data for LKFs.

fesom_data: read FESOM data from eerie catalogues, interpolate and create nc file \n
icon_data: read ICON data from eerie catalogues, interpolate and create nc file
use lkf_detect to detect LKFs, save them as images and create a gif

interpolate_and_create_nc_file: read the FESOM 1km data from work paths, interpolate and create nc file
detect_and_track_lkfs: detect and track LKFs (more in depth, also containing the finetuning) 
interpolation_functions: contains the functions needed for the interpolation routines
lkf_statistics: do statistics on detectet and tracked LKFs (number and lifetime)
